# C Implementation of the NYT Wordle Game 

A semester long project where I and my team researched and developed multiple script files, header files, and text files to implement the “Wordle” game. Loop implementation, functions with parameters, and pointers were heavily used in implementation of such.

Started: February 2023
Finished April 2023 

All of which is found in this repository.
